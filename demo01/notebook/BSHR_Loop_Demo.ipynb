This phenomenon has occurred worldwide over the past two centuries, reversing the unprecedented population growth of the post-Malthusian period. The demographic transition strengthens economic growth by reducing dilution of capital and land stock, increasing investment in human capital, and increasing the size of the labor force relative to the total population. However, the theory and model are imprecise when applied to individual countries due to specific social, political, and economic factors affecting particular populations. The existence of a demographic transition is widely accepted in the social sciences due to the historical correlation linking dropping fertility to social and economic development. Scholars debate whether industrialization and higher incomes lead to lower population or whether lower populations lead to industrialization and higher incomes. Various proposed factors such as higher per capita income, lower mortality, old-age security, and the rise of demand for human capital are involved. Human capital gradually increased in the second stage of the industrial revolution, which coincided with the demographic transition. The investment of human capital in children by families may be the beginning of the demographic transition.\u001b[0m\n",

Many people were also affected by the economic and social changes that occurred as a result of the wars, and some were displaced for generations.
