hey everyone David Shapiro here with another podcast interview today I am super excited to introduce Anna Bernstein one of the world's first uh professional prompt engineers Anna is wonderful to talk to very very bright um and just a wonderful charismatic person and so uh without further Ado um Anna would you like to tell us a little bit about yourself your history how you got to where you are and what you're working on um yeah I uh am a prompt engineer at copy AI um kind of a strange path to get there um but uh I yeah create the prompt infrastructure uh at copy Ai and it's a bit of a it's both a building role for things we need and a bit of a mad scientist role for things that might be possible um which is a lot of fun um and uh I grew up in New York come from a very non-tech background until I started at this role um so like I said it's been kind of kind of a strange path to get here but I um I love it I love performance engineering and I love where I am in the industry so excellent thanks so much yeah so during our our original um like pre-podcast talk one of the things that you mentioned was that you always had a love of language and I don't remember exactly how you how you articulated it but that you really love to zoom in and get into the weeds of language so I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about your background and and your love of language because that really stood out to me yeah um I mean I've always wanted to be a writer um and uh I think I have sort of a slightly obsessive approach to language um which can be a good or a bad thing uh certainly not the best when you're trying to figure out the words to choose on a podcast um but I really like taking an analytical approach to language but specifically to like creative language creative writing literary work um I think uh it it can be really fruitful to like drill down on that um and that's manifested in a couple ways before this job um the first um was uh I don't know if you want me to go into this yet sort of education and stuff or or uh yeah please go for it yeah we'll we'll jump around just as it makes sense so um I was uh I had a minor uh I was doing a minor in Arabic uh translation specifically like fusa translation which is a lot of um medieval poetry as well as the Quran and the youth and I um really loved how compact the grammar was in a way it wasn't flowery it was extremely efficient and extremely elaborate at the same time and you know a forward sentence since could be like you know an eight-word sentence or much longer in English um but it was a lot of puzzle solving in regards to language and a lot of like like a single diacritic Mark could like change the entire meaning of a sentence so you really had to be extremely precise and at the same time the puzzles you were unlocking weren't dry they were like these beautiful verses and once you got it right once you had all the like you know oh this is an adjustment or whatever and you like unlocked the puzzle of that verse you were rewarded with like oh my God that meaning is beautiful so it was this like combination of like analytical um like approach to it and like puzzle solving approach that like ultimately the puzzle you were solving was like a beautiful poetic meaning um and that I moved on from uh College thinking that would never be relevant ever to my career um but I kind of find that that's there's a parallel area to prompt engineering for sure yeah that's that's such a wonderful story and my my fiance is a uh she loves Latin and so she tells me all very similar stories about translating The Aeneid um and just uh it's it's fascinating because especially for for monolinguists like myself um or mono Globs probably is the right word um like we're only familiar with English so I have I have a bunch of different directions I want to go um but I guess first well actually let's let's rewind because this was a really great intro so let's rewind a minute and tell tell us a little bit about how you how you landed this job it started at a jazz club right um yeah I um love going out to a jazz club when it's raining and just having a single drink by myself and it's a wonderful like ritual that I do maybe once a month and um I did that um went to go check out a new place um and started talking to someone there um who was uh one year Zhang who's um who was an early person at copy AI um and we had this moment where our it was like oh your brain does a really similar thing to what my brain is doing like we just sort of got along really well um and uh you know kept hanging out and there was a moment where he was trying to figure out this was like the second or third time we hung out he was trying to figure out what the um I'm not forgetting the name of it but there's there's a word in uh there's an Indonesian word for a certain type of flavor it's similar to a mommy but it's specifically Indonesian now I don't remember what it is and I would mispronounce it anyway but basically he was like oh I can't think of it um hold on and he pulled up his phone and started doing something this was summer of 2021. well I just want to start doing something and I was like what what is that um and it was the playground for gp3 um on his phone and he was he had like typed in stuff of like describing the flavor and then like asking what it was um and he like explained to me what he was doing and what the playground was gp3 and I find this was early so this is like Da Vinci just based Da Vinci um and I was immediately like oh wait I think maybe if we just just wrote the first part of the sentence instead rather than asking the question out right it would just like autocomplete or like I don't know I just like very arrogantly immediately had a billion ideas for how to do this thing that I barely understood um and we got the flavored name and uh it was kind of hooked and you know a little while after that he was like why don't you um you know we've tried a lot of people in this role we're not even sure if this is a role at the time they were like oh you just sort of improve the examples in our case shots or whatever um it's more of a copywriting role like that and like they were but they had tried a number of people in that role um and it it kind of wasn't working so they were really taking a shot in the dark with someone when you met at a jazz club um and uh I remember Chris Chris Lou who's one of the co-founders of cop AI when he was explaining it to me I loved the way he explained it he was like it's kind of like a spell like you know in Harry Potter when they say a spell slightly wrong and it like does the slightly wrong thing but they have to like get the flick of the wrist right and like you just have to like get the spell right but you don't know what this you're inventing the spell and I was like that's that I can do that so um yeah it started there on on contract freelance and then um when if I was adding value they hired me so yeah wonderful that is such a great story that's like a perfect origin story um so yeah so you mentioned that you you work on the prompt infrastructure for copy Ai and obviously we want to respect um you know any proprietary information but since you since you've been there and and you know you work on language and you've had this really analytical View and it sounds like you almost kind of had an intuitive um kind of take to it um so I have I have a couple couple directions that I want to go there's one could you could you describe you know how your background your study of of Arabic or anything that you might have done before then because I believe you mentioned that you um you did a you were a research assistant before that as well um but then how does all that tie into prompt engineering and obviously like if they've hired you full time it has worked out well so what about about you your experience your interests has um made like made you ideal for this role I know I asked a bunch of questions so just I'll leave it up to you pick whichever direction you want to go first yeah well I think um it's so much what I was saying about you know this sort of like analytical approach to what makes language beautiful or what makes language compelling thinking about the like specifics of when you look at the language itself but also like the audience's interaction with language that makes it compelling but I uh can't say it was necessarily all of my I mean I had a wonderful education in New York um and then uh had a great two years of education at McAllister in Minnesota and then dropped out um because of health issues I I couldn't get to class every day um went back to New York and um worked partly as a copywriter but as you mentioned partly as a um like research assistant mainly for like historical and biographical projects um I worked on a book called women who made New York with Julie scofo where I um got to research a lot of different women and that was that was really uh wonderful and fascinating digging up like the exact right fact about someone that sort of unlocked their whole narrative which I guess when I as I say that that sort of fits with this theme that I'm realizing of like the sort of like slight obsessiveness and like finding just the right thing for like a narrative or creative um purpose um I also um write poetry which I was the other day I was at a party my friend was like here is poetess anniversity and I was like never introduce me that way again um but I yeah I have some some poetry in journals um and uh a couple of short stories um but writing poetry is up for me it's a it's obsessive process but it's also one that involves seeing many different approaches at the same time and keeping them in mind and often like mentally not throwing them away in case you go down one route and it doesn't work and then you have to back up and go down a different route and often it's also a process of choosing when to go with your first thought and when to go with your like 246 thought um it's rarely like your fifth thought I find personally but um but I think like that sort of um thinking of like what's the most intuitive thing to do here balanced with like what's an unintuitive thing to do here that I haven't maybe thought of yet that would be a better way of approaching this um I think is it's helpful along with obviously the editing process of poetry is so like granular and like you have to and even short stories like there's this you know tip of like if you find yourself um taking in and or taking out and putting in the same comma over and over again your story is probably done otherwise it's probably not um so it's it's yeah it kind of all all ties together in a way especially because when you're writing you're trying to write for yourself but also write for your audience and you're trying to think of how you're writing interacts with another brain or a potential other brain or potentially many other brains but you're also trying not to think about that as well but it's but you you have to be thinking about that and with the with prompt engineering there's this balance of treating the AI as human in a weird way where you're like what how would a human do this what parts of the human thought process process am I missing when I analyze this task like what what is missing from this task in this sort of undercurrent of it that isn't being provided to the AI um and sometimes that's better with like treating it as more human but then there are also ways where you're like I am treating it as too human and I need to like back up and think of like the specific limitations and the specific powers that it has and that each different model has so that was very rambling I'm sorry well I uh I have good news I was able to follow it but I think I think that there's I mean gosh there's so much that I agree with you on because you know I've been uh slightly obsessed myself with language models um you know and uh so yeah you mentioned a few things a couple times that I want to um unpack a little bit so one was audience so you've mentioned audience a couple times like you know what it think thinking about the language model as your potential audience you know maybe it's maybe it helps to think about it as human or or not depending on um so there's there's that aspect um but you've also talked about how you you tend to think through like you know the the undercurrents of what is and is not present in the language that you're feeding the model or the prompt engineering but one thing that really stood out to me the thing that most stood out to me um as you were sharing that was the process of right fighting poetry and you said that like you know sometimes there's the intuitive path there's the unintuitive path sometimes you pay attention to the first thing and sometimes it's the 200th thing um and that sounds kind of like prompt Engineering in some respects and so what I wanted to to do was explore this idea that creative writing or poetry in particular which is a very uh specific use of language um how how your your your mental approaches to this how that might have played into your abilities as a prompt engineer what your observations are and then finally um you know editing if that kind of figures into it as a skill I want to think about these things as skills that have been developed or intuitions that have been developed so what are what are your uh associations there with poetry and audience yeah I think choosing the exact right word um is in order to elicit the right reaction is extremely important and I actually don't even know which one I'm talking about when I say that because I mean it for both um and elicit the right reaction although means very different things for both those those things and one it's you know you're almost trying to by finding the exact right word in the prompt like almost task locate for the right reaction from the AI and I think people under utilize word choice in their prompts they sort of rely on approach which is good to take a variety of approaches that's also very good but sometimes I find that an approach I want to take doesn't work on the first try or like the 10th try with the wording I'm trying like sometimes it is really helpful like you can make this crazy approach that you thought just you know wasn't viable work when you like really hit the right like vocabulary for it um like there's a specific I won't go into too much detail but there's a specific approach that way that I was like oh it doesn't work it doesn't work and like no matter the synonyms I try to and then I you know on this phrase thoroughly and faithfully and that like unlock the whole thing um and the same thing can happen with poetry I mean instead of the right generation happening what you're looking for is that like kick in the chest when you read it which is a bit more ephemeral and whatever but um but you know for me it does feel in some ways like a binary when I read poetry like either that happens for me or it doesn't um so yeah I think a lot of it comes back to language as act and you know language of speech act and that kind of thing and this is like a very like prompt engineering is a very literal like concrete example of like language as like a speech act like a like a piece of speech that by being spoken and acts something um so I think they both belong to that category um that's maybe a little more like I don't know maybe you're looking for something a little more practical I think word choice and I think in poetry something that's also underutilized this variety of approach when it comes to like I know I I need to use that more when I when it's when something's not working I've gone down a pathway for a while to like go back and like think about the whole like approach of the poem rather than like line by line necessarily um or the wording of lines and that does happen with prompt engineering as well where you realize you have over engineered something and the approach just isn't working and you need to like take a step back from it so there's a lot of parallels there absolutely one of the Cardinal rules that I have learned is uh more often than not less is more sometimes if you're really struggling with a prompt it's just like just simplify it and see what happens um so one of the one another uh phrase that you've that you've used kind of differently um when you were describing um like working through uh or getting getting the right effect from creative writing and another and you use this word again or this these pair of words for um for getting the prompt getting the machine to do what you wanted to do is locking versus unlocking trying to unlock whether it's a particular response from a person from a reader or trying to to get that that feeling for yourself or then of course getting the performance from the machine so that's a very particular choice of words and it resonates with me but I wanted to ask you what what do you mean when you use that that um I don't know if it's an analogy but the the adjectives of of locked versus unlocked like it's almost like you're trying to pull something out of the machine right just like you're trying to pull something out of a reader or yourself yeah yeah it's similar to that you know that the thing you're trying to say the emotion is almost a strange word for it it's been wrong but let's say the emotion you're trying to get at is somewhere within yourself also I mean you're your primary reader as you're writing poetry so you're trying to like create that feeling for yourself too um and you know it's somewhere in the big jumble of all the words that could ever exist and you're trying to find the right ones um in order to yeah unlock it or it would be like find it um and when you're working with the AI you're working with sort of a toddler that knows everything um but also when you're writing poetry you're like thinking about how you're writing for like every one and not everyone in the world but like uh you're not writing typically for one person you're writing for like an audience of brains so it's actually not that dissimilar in a weird way where you're like this is it doesn't have to like unlock or task locate or however we want to put it that response in every single person as long as it like tasks locates for it in the people to for whom that emotion exists and or like that particular connection exists of experience um or of enjoying your poetry or whatever that sentence got the hell away from me but uh yeah it's it's the more I like think about parallels the more it does come back to like past location of emotion for poetry um which is kind of strange I hadn't thought about it that way before excellent excellent yeah so you you mentioned task locating a few times and um my my fiance is a librarian uh by training and so she's she's uh shared that term with me but from from your perspective could you share with our audience um what what it is that you mean by task locating um as it pertains to prompt engineering you know with with large language models but also with human audiences and you know you've you've talked a lot about audience and and alluded to like theory of mind like you you uh model what's going on in the mind of either the machine or your audience of one your audience of yourself or audience of many many brains so talk to us a little bit about task locating what what is that um task locating is essentially tricking the AI no it's um finding uh for for if what you wanted to generate typically exists within a specific context it's recreating that context for it so that it is more likely to generate the thing you want um you know like if you wanted to generate a name for whatever reason you weren't just doing this in a similar way you could be like you know paper like paper title bye and then it would generate a name even though you haven't told it to generate a name so that's like a very simple like example of task okay location but the idea of it crops up in a lot of other ways you can sort of like a lot of it gets fuzzy was also sort of like priming the model in different ways um and it also intersects I think with um like I'm not totally sure what the industry term is for this right now but it tends to instead to change ground but like irregular K shots where the example is actually of a different cast um but even with regular kit you you are kind of task locating for like um you know here's this example here's this example here's this example you're like trying to convince it that somewhere within it exists a list of the perfect examples that you need um so yeah there's I guess there's like concrete task location of like things that actually exist in its Corpus and then there's a bit of deceptive task location for like things that you're trying to tell it exists um but uh of a common way to sort of test locate a prime is um through like author voice you know you see it all the I mean it's in every it's like you know you are Dan you are uh even like people tell like you are a sentient AI that's really good at stuff like helps and it's it's um that's a form of task location in my opinion the author voice thing yeah I um in one of my books I called that uh agent model so like you tell it like this is what you are and this is what you're capable of and it's able to just kind of step into those shoes and say oh this is what I am and and like you said how did you say you said like kind of tricking the AI or or kind of getting it to confabulate into this latent space that it's got that's wonderful um I'm glad to know that another human thinks about this the way that I do it's very reassuring um because I've tried to explain some of this to folks and they and and some some people don't get it because one thing that I have found is that um computer science people sometimes think of it as a machine learning model first but you and I we we seem to think of it as a as a language instrument first I I don't want to put words in your mouth do you do you agree with that do you think of this as primarily um what did you call it earlier a speech act right like you don't do you think of it as a machine or do you think of it otherwise I definitely still think of it as a machine um you know it's um the there have been Concepts over the past however long it's been year and year and a half hour long where I've um learned more about the sort of like not even broad concepts of machine learning because a lot of them are specific but sort of from a non-technic like this lever does this it works this way and like that helps I find a lot in explaining a lot of its behavior um but then there are also things I end up explaining to the people who make them where it's like will it acts this way and I think it's because of this or like have you noticed this Behavior where it is like inevitably getting away from them a little bit like you can't predict all of its Behavior via the technical side of machine learning that's almost the point of it um so it is like I mean it's a sign that the the technical side of it has been very successful that we are now like thinking of it in a non-technical way yeah that that makes total sense um especially kind of the way that you just articulated that that at the end like it it is a sign of success that it's kind of gotten away from from Strictly the engineering side or the or the scientific or technical side by virtue of the fact that it is working because it is not uh explicitly like maybe deterministic or fully mechanistic um so what I wanted to to explore a little bit more on this uh line of reasoning or or thinking was how does so you said that you do think of it kind of as a machine and you try and you know observe its behaviors and and establish reasons for the behaviors or or at least explanations a model for the behavior um but how does how does language overlay or intersect with that because you know at the beginning of the conversation you mentioned all kinds of um aspects of language Arabic language you know diacritics and and grammar and everything so based on your use of large language models how much does how much does do aspects of language such as you mentioned you know vocabulary word choice different approaches um but what about what about grammar and syntax and other aspects of language how do you perceive those as having been woven into into the machine um so to speak not totally sure I understand the question I'm sorry that's fine I probably didn't ask that well um okay so asking it another way um here let's do some human prompt engineering um so the prompt that I just gave you didn't work so let me try a different prompt um so word choice is very important for prompt engineering right how how important is grammar or syndrome oh I see okay yeah um yeah I mean you're the way you choose to phrase something the style of syntaxis can also like can indicate a level of sophistication of writing versus the Simplicity of writing and maybe you want that Simplicity of writing you want direct uh you know simple cause and effects informational writing for your readers or maybe you want it to be a bit more human sounding or literary and that the style of I find like rhythm um especially with example following models the the style of the the Rhythm of the sentence and having a you know a classic sort of writing world having like a variety of rhythms in your sentences um variety of number of Clauses in your sentences um tends to make a Threading I find more sophisticated um they're also you know things like creating links when you want it to do a task like creating links um via the verbs you use where you can use causative verbs rather than linking things um with uh like just like being like you have a bunch of briefs and a bunch of these things or like like a bunch of briefs and a bunch of pieces of content you can actually link those positively rather than just kind of putting them near each other in the sentence um there's also like this isn't quite great but when it comes to word choice there's like approaches where sometimes referring to something in different places with synonyms if you can refer to it multiple times throughout the prompts um like referring to it with synonyms each time can help the model sort of triangulate on what it is um but if you're using that section as sort of a tool for another section you want to refer back to that section you really need parity between what you call it what you label it and what you call it in the sentence you can't like approximate it the way you would with a human being necessarily or it won't work as well um so this is like structurally there's a lot of stuff there's also the whole like approach I'm sure that of like you can put things in the future tense the present tense the past tense you can say you've already written this explain to me how you did it you can do a lot of weird stuff um with yeah just uh with tents especially I find that can really switch up abilities yeah absolutely um especially by making those positive assertions it just kind of rolls with it and says okay sure like you told me this thing is true so I'll just assume that that's true or at least that seems to be how it interprets um that one thing that you said earlier um that I I wanted to unpack before we we take a brief break and then come back to to change to change gears was you said that uh that this kind of AI is like a toddler that knows everything and I thought that that was uh very uh illustrative um but I like that and I wanted I was wondering if you could unpack how you how you came to that understanding of large language models um I mean it's a little trite it's not like totally true but it's like you know it's close enough it's how I describe it uh at parties when I'm trying to describe my job um but yeah it it's I mean it it has a huge wealth of knowledge and also often not a lot of common sense although obviously that's getting better all the time um but it doesn't you know have common sense the way a human being has Common Sense where when we're in an interaction with another person we are thinking there's like a tent we put out this is going to be confusing genetically there's a tent we put over the interaction I feel like of like the other person's intent what they want out of the conversation like especially if we're like trying to do something for them obviously it's like what is the goal um and it doesn't always sometimes it doesn't have the tent over what it's doing and sometimes it puts the tent up over here or like just or it's upside down or like whatever it it's not always as good as that as a human being is um where you're like you kind of did this you did what you thought you were doing well but but a human being would understand that that's not and that's what I like when I'm editing other people's prompts so much of what I'm doing is going back into the prompt and going this you didn't even say like what you thought like what like you're you're telling me out loud what you want and that's not what you told the AI you told it to do something totally different and it's like or something like a little bit off and it's taking you very literally and doing that thing rather than doing what a human would do and like understanding the overall task um and that reminds me of being a child I didn't know what was going on I I definitely remember I probably still have moments like that but that definitely reminds me of uh you know being yeah literally being a toddler and like not um understanding often dynamics of situations I was in except they didn't have like all the details of the War of 1812 or whatever in my brain yeah absolutely um that was that's such a great uh way to elucidate that um okay so we're going to take a quick break obviously for the audience it'll be instantaneous but we'll be right back and we will um we'll change focus on to a little bit a little bit other uh aspects of language and language models and where AI is going so we'll be back in just a moment hey everybody and we're back from our short break um so uh wanted to change gears for the last uh section of this episode um uh as as the audience uh may or may not know uh one of the key things that I want to do with this podcast is to demystify AI for 2023 and for the world because things are changing so incredibly quickly and that's why I'm having these interviews with people who are at The Cutting Edge um or who have past experience to draw from in order to help provide guidance and kind of shine some light on the situation for the rest of us so um Anna I wanted to ask you where do you see AI going particularly how are things going to change in 2023 what are your thoughts on kind of the state of things and where it's going in the immediate future pretty difficult question to answer um I think uh as we see the writing quality itself of current llms improve and get more human um there will probably be kind of a parallel debate about um like people right now the debate for writing is like will students generate essays with the AI and I think as the writing quality gets better and better it'll move into will people when writing competitions using bits and pieces maybe not hold up but like from the AI it's parallel to the debate that's going on with like visual art um and AI visual art um and uh I think I hope that that'll sort of even itself out people will realize that um that's kind of like how 3D printing didn't kill sculpture um it's I and I hope people embrace it as a tool I think maybe that won't happen in 2023 but I do think that'll happen um you know as just rather than thinking of it as competition thinking of it as like an augmentation like another brain to think with but not a replacement for your brain um and uh and I I mean I also think the nature of like search is going to change the nature of like finding information is going to change as we get you know things like chat GPT which are you know reliable um and sort of more conversational uh like returners of information um that in a way have like a better idea of like the tent that I was talking about earlier like how do I keep saying like the tent and that's so close to the word intent which is really just what I mean but the like your overall intent that like I mean Google has poured so much into intent of search and when you make it conversational and make it an AI like chat gbt that it's able to do it really well so I think that's going to change I know I've already used it that way I um was bored with the deli sandwiches I was ordering my usual roster and whenever I searched a new type of deli sandwich or like deli sandwich comp best deli whatever I tried to search it was like here's some great Jolly sandwiches to make at home and I was like that's not helpful and it's not like I need like a for like a New York Deli like what's a good combination um and I use chat GPT for it and it gave me a slightly weird but pretty good sandwich I don't remember what was in it but it was pretty delicious anyway so my point is I think the nature of search is going to change and I hope that the nature or how people think about like creative augmentation is Gonna Change that's that's that's a phenomenal View and and I am right there with you in terms of one just hoping for people to embrace it and and thinking of it as an augmentation not a replacement something that helps make our lives you know better easier whatever um that's a great idea using it for uh coming up with a better sandwich I haven't used it for that yet I have used it to help with my own writing and Drafting and and and and and those sorts of tasks um so you know you pointed out that like uh 3D printing didn't kill sculpture you know hopefully things like Dolly and mid-journey and stable diffusion don't kill graphic art I don't think it's going to um but certainly there is a lot of consternation over over that those boundaries right now I think that's kind of probably the more diplomatic way of saying it um and certainly there's a lot of there's a lot of pain on both sides there's AI artists who are relieved that they are finally able to express themselves um with with the help of these tools and then there are um you know other artists that are also kind of facing pain because um they feel like something's being taken away from them and and certainly there's there's huge disruption um and I really empathize with with people on both sides I've had uh YouTube comments from people on both both sides um just expressing like yeah this kind of this kind of sucks so with that I wanted to ask a little bit more you know what are you what are you worried about you know you mentioned uh certainly like uh new what was it New York City band chat GPT in schools um so are there anything is there anything else that you're worried about um and then beyond that what are you excited about for AI in the coming year um yeah I mean that's basically what I'm wearing is it's like when it comes to the writing side of it I'm worried about um you know there is an educational element to like crafting an essay about a topic you learn the topic much better it sort of doesn't matter the point of crafting the essay is not for the essay to get published somewhere and read by other people when you're in school so when the function of it is that you become more educated by crafting the piece of writing painstakingly on your own and students are replacing that with generating it with an AI they're losing an educational element and that's concerning to me um for sure um in terms of like the flip side of that and it's like I think I'm excited to continue or for like the creative side of language models to continue to develop part of my a huge part of my job at copy AI is that we offer like a creative more creative generation than you might find from like chat gbt or whatever and more of a variety of approach if you don't like the first generation you can regenerate and get something different that's like a big part of what we offer um and yeah creativity of approach variety of approach creativity and human sounding language even if it's maybe a little bit less precise um and I really just want to like keep keep exploring that keep seeing that in other places um and I really want people I mean I touched on this before but I really want the writing world to like Embrace this as a really powerful tool that's because the the ultimate goal of your writing you haven't come up with it any less in a way like you're still putting this writing in front of if it's beautiful writing it's beautiful writing and the purpose of it is the response of the audience and whether or not the beauty of it was like partly generated outside the idea for it was partly generated using an ALT like brain augmentation that you're controlling or like your own brain like you crafted it and it's beautiful and it's a listing that response in readers and it's a listing that responsible readers because of their Human Experience so I I don't think there is there's you know um I'm debating whether I can share something that happened with an open AI model but I don't think I can oh man I'll I'll come back to it at some point someday I'll share that story but um I'm I'm really excited for that side of AI to kind of Blossom excellent yeah and obviously if there's something that you're not comfortable sharing no big deal that's fine that's fine um yeah so like as as a creative myself like I I kind of split the split Two Worlds I'm on the you know the research side and and the creative side you know I definitely uh feel you there on like let's embrace it and and while you're speaking something occurred to me like if as a novel novelist if I take my novel to a a critique group and I get ideas from from a critique group um and then I take it to an editor it's not a product of strictly my own brain um same with uh these tools and I'm not saying that like okay you know an editor is is equivalent to getting help from chat GPT or even having a Ghostwriter right because it's still a human but I but one thing that you focused on was if it elicits the right response from the from the receiver of that art um is is that like you know that's part of the goal and we don't have to we don't have to unpack that unless there's any um points that you wanted to to dive deeper in before we move on to kind of the last section of the of the podcast yeah I think um just one thing quickly is that for something like visual art um there's a worry there about I think lots of craft like art versus crap and like but the craft side of art where people aren't people aren't debating or people are but there's this kind of like well yeah you came up with the idea for it and whatever but like that's that's only part of it part of it is like crafting of the object and the skill that goes into that in the artistic sensibility that goes into using that skill and I can't call in on that because I'm not a visual artist and I think that's a very but I do think that's a very fair debate to have when it comes to writing that the Divide between like craft and art is always more nebulous because there isn't like a craft aspect to it writing is very strange as like sometimes when I I'm like even when I'm asked to read poetry at a poetry reading sometimes it feels like I'm getting up on stage and being like look how good I can walk and then like walking back and forth because it's like something that most of us can do and I'm like I can do this even better and like I can do it in a way that means something and I'm like just reading words off a page that I wrote um so that divide has always been a bit more nebulous and I think that's part of what makes people nervous about this is there's like but also why why I think when it comes to augmenting creativity when it comes to language I actually think it there to me there's less of a gray area there I I don't feel as like conflicted about it because you know you're not losing like craft it's like a just a new tool for something that already was like not quite literal craft anyway that makes sense and you know the it's not a Perfect Analogy but you know the the computer didn't destroy education um you know even though it made thing makes things some things easier some things are a little more convoluted and yeah I do hope that we can adapt to these tools and and think of them as just more tools extension of the art um so I wanted to the the the final few questions that I had for you the first one is what do you personally want to achieve like uh you mentioned at the beginning of the episode that or maybe it was just before we started but you said like you know you never would have thought that you'd be a prompt engineer so how has AI changed your life in your direction in your career and what do you want to personally achieve in the coming you know year or two or three well I'd love to um extend this career and keep keep doing this um keep like I'd love to be you know one of many people but like be on the Forefront of like steering where these models are going and what they're capable of through prompt engineering and prompt optimization and prompt training and stuff and um I think some people see um you know like the ability of the AI is this and it's ramping up and prompt engineering is like this where like as we get closer like you know this like prompt engineering is me did less and less and I see it a lot more like that um so I'm excited to see like if prompt engineering is capable of what it's capable of right now what will it be capable of 10 years from now and I really want to be part of that future um I'm not totally sure what that looks like from a career standpoint I'll get back to you on that yeah absolutely I mean we can we could no more predict Dolly too and then chat GPT than we could anything else so who knows what's going to change within the next 12 months um but yeah like you I I also want to just stay part of it because whatever's going on it's it's really cool and it also feels really important um so uh who do you want to get connected with um is there anyone that you would like to reach out to you on LinkedIn or or Twitter or however however you want to um engage with the world is there anyone that you uh want to invite into your professional life or or into your sphere um come on come all I don't know uh no I um you know I'm interested in connecting with sort of in the same way that copy I was like unsure whether this was a role that would add value I'm interested in like thinking about what are other you know Industries where they don't realize this could add value so if you're like unsure I'd love to like discuss that with you um if you are one of the other few prompt Engineers out there a few of you we've connected on LinkedIn but like I feel like it's you know like where there are a handful of us and I would love to get connected with anyone else who whether that's your official title or not if it's something you do professionally I would love to talk to you um and then you know also if you're uh someone who's interested in getting into it especially if you come from a non-tech background but you think it sounds like something that makes sense for you you have a kind of like I've said this word a bunch now at this point but like an obsessiveness is kind of important and like really loving language is important um and more just like loving like semantics and like approach to this thing is important so um if you're interested in that and if you're interested in AI from like uh literary or like writing quality standpoint um I'd love to love to get in touch wonderful wonderful excellent um and uh quick follow-up question where where is best for people to to connect with you on LinkedIn Twitter probably on LinkedIn yeah okay um if people are interested I also have I uh I know um I have a few friends who would like yell at me if I didn't share this so I also have my website uh which has my writing on it that's been published it's poetry and short stories so it's not totally relevant but that's just my name.com annabernstein.com but if you want to get in touch about prompt engineering definitely my LinkedIn would be would be better perfect perfect and um I always like to wrap up these episodes by just asking um asking my guests what are the what are the words of wisdom that you want to put out into the world um just any any final any final words what what is it that you would like the world to know or to hear or to think about um there's there's something formulating but it's not quite coming it's something about how like creativity we don't have to forfeit the realm of creativity as like a particularly human Realm just because we've created a new tool that helps us with it I don't know that's really beautiful yeah no that's that's really beautiful and so we'll we'll leave it at that we do not have to Forfeit the realm of creativity just because we've created a tool so thank you so much for you yeah yeah thank you so much for your uh for your time Anna and um I of course wish you well and as always I really enjoyed um having this time to to speak with you um and thanks everyone for watching and uh check back in and be good
